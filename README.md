# Description

We created a web app that sells anchor charts. An anchor chart is a tool used to support instruction. As you teach a lesson, you create an anchor chart, together with your students, that captures the most important content and relevant strategies. 

1. We created a landing page that has consist of a registration portal and login portal for viewing different anchor charts. 
2. User will be required to register and login using a secure password.
3. Once the user has registered and logged in to the site, a selection of various Anchor Charts will displayed along with pricing and subject information.
